I am currently a 4th year PhD Candidate at Harvard studying causal machine learning. 
My research interests include using deep learning models to estimate causal effects, and 
how causality can be used to improve the **reasoning** capabilities and **safety** of 
multimodal LLMs. 
I am co-advised by [Dr. Andrew Beam](https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/andrew-beam/) and  [Dr. James Robins](https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/james-m-robins/). 
I am also a member of the [Causal Lab](https://causalab.hsph.harvard.edu/).

In my free time, I enjoy reading philosophical books (currently on the second volume of [THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation) by Schopenhauer),
and working out (a mix of strength training and Pilates).
