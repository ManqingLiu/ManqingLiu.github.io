I recently finished my first dissertation project, and I wanted to share the lessons I learned from it. 
Note that these lessons are specific to my experience, and may not apply to everyone, but I hope they can be helpful to others,
especially those who don't come from a traditional computer science background (like me) but are interested 
in machine learning research.
