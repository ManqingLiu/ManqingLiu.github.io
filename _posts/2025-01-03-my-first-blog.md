I recently completed my first PhD project and I must say it was a bittersweet experience. 
I learnt a lot from the project, but I also made a lot of mistakes. 
In this post, I will share the bitter lesson I learnt from my first PhD project.

A disclaimer: I am not an expert in this field, but I am sharing my experience in the hope 
that it will help others avoid the mistakes I made, especially those who, like me, don't come from a 
traditional computer science background.

## The bitter lesson 1: Start with an existing repository if you can find one and build on it

## The bitter lesson 2: Check public datasets first before simulating your own data

## The bitter lesson 3: Don't be afraid to ask for help

## The bitter lesson 4: Don't be afraid to change the codes provided by your advisor

## The bitter lesson 5: Keep a daily log of your experiments

## The bitter lesson 6: Instead of topdown approach, start with the simplest model first
