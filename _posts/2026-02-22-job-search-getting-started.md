I'm graduating in May 2026, and it's time to figure out what comes next. I've decided to keep a public diary of my job search, partly for accountability, partly because I think the process is worth documenting honestly.

Finding a job in the AI/LLM/AI alignment field as a PhD student is super challenging. How will I know which job is the best fit for me? For an engineering-heavy role, what comparative advantage do I have over college grads with a CS degree, or someone without a graduate degree but with many years of engineering experience?

I spent my first three years learning the "math" — probability, statistical inference, some coding classes. Most of the courses I took were math-heavy but not related to LLMs at all (even the machine learning classes were very classical ML, with the exception of maybe one NLP course I took at MIT).

My first dissertation project had nothing to do with LLMs. The second one tried to connect to it by introducing the doubly robust estimator in the value function for tree search, but it still wasn't on the core algorithms of LLMs themselves.

Then I joined a reading seminar on AI safety in the summer of 2024, and it got me intrigued when I found out that causality can be used in mechanistic interpretability. But it wasn't until the summer of 2025 that I really got hands-on experience with AI alignment research through the [MARS program](https://www.cambridgeaisafety.org/mars-old).

When I open LinkedIn job recommendations, I see roles related to LLMs in pre-training, post-training, alignment, evals, and more — from FAANG, the top-tier labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind), and tons of startups founded by CS undergrads.

It's a bit overwhelming to find my place. So here I'm dumping my random thoughts to: 1) clarify my thinking; 2) log my progress on the job search; and 3) hopefully make someone in a similar situation feel a little less alone when they read these :)

Let the journey begin.

More soon.
