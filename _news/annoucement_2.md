Thrilled to announce my acceptance to [MARS (Mentorship for Alignment Research Students)](https://www.cambridgeaisafety.org/mars) 
at Cambridge, UK this summer! I'll be developing novel metrics to measure Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning health in AI systems. 
My research involves training models to exhibit specific CoT pathologies, then evaluating how well our new metrics can detect 
these failure modesâ€”crucial work for ensuring AI systems reason reliably and transparently.
